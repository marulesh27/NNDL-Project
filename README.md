## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a **Salary Prediction Model** using an  
**Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** implemented with **TensorFlow/Keras**.

The objective is to predict an individual's salary based on several attributes such as:

- Experience  
- Age  
- Education level  
- Job role  
- Other relevant features  

The dataset used for training is sourced from **Kaggle**.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built using TensorFlow/Keras.

### ✔ Layers Used:
- Input Layer  
- Dense Layers with ReLU activation  
- Output Layer for regression prediction  

### ✔ Training Details:
- Epochs: **100**  
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE  

You may update results here if needed.
