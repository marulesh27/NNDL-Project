## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a **Salary Prediction Model** using an  
**Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** implemented with **TensorFlow/Keras**.

The goal is to predict an individual's salary based on features such as:
- Experience  
- Age  
- Education level  
- Job role  
- Other relevant attributes  

The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**.
